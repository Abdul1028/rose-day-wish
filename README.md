# Rose Day Wish App

This application allows you to create a personalized Rose Day wish for your special someone.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

## Configuration

1.  **Update Couple's Names:**
    *   Navigate to the `config` directory.
    *   Open the `content.ts` file.
    *   Modify the names within this file to reflect the couple you're creating the wish for.

2.  **Modify Sender and Receiver Names:**
    *   In the same `config/content.ts` file (or specify if it's elsewhere), find the fields for sender (e.g., `fromName`) and receiver (e.g., `toName`).
    *   Update these names accordingly.

## Customization

Make your wish even more personal by customizing the media files:

1.  **Modify Your Photo:**
    *   Replace the placeholder image `public/images/your-photo.jpg` with your desired photo.
    *   Ensure the new photo has the same name (`your-photo.jpg`) or update the reference in the application code if you use a different name.

2.  **Modify Your Video:**
    *   Replace the placeholder video `public/video/your-video.mp4` with your desired video.
    *   Ensure the new video has the same name (`your-video.mp4`) or update the reference in the application code.
    *   *(Note: The original request mentioned `.mp`, which is not a standard video extension. I've assumed `.mp4`. Please adjust if your video format is different.)*

3.  **Modify Your Audio:**
    *   Replace the placeholder audio file `public/music/your-audio.mp3` with your desired music or audio message.
    *   Ensure the new audio file has the same name (`your-audio.mp3`) or update the reference in the application code.

Enjoy creating and sharing your personalized Rose Day wish!
